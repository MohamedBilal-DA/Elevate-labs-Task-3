## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **bakery sales data** to uncover insights about revenue, product performance, and customer buying patterns.  

Using **Power Query** and **Excel**, I transformed raw datasets, merged multiple sources, and built a professional **dashboard** with KPIs and visualizations.  

🔑 The dashboard answers:  
- 💰 What is the **total revenue** and **total products sold**?  
- 🥖 Which is the **most sold product**?  
- 📅 What is the **day with the highest sales**?  
- 🏆 Which products generate the **most revenue**?  
- ⏰ What are the **peak sales hours**?  
- 📊 What are the **monthly sales trends**?
